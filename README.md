# paint-app
My first major object-oriented java project:
A smaller version of MS Paint with an additional layers feature
Created my own components and made minimal use of java swing (only JFrame & Jpanel)
Navigation Controls & shortcuts:
CTRL+N : New File
CTRL+S : Save File
CTRL+F : Open File Window
CTRL+C : Open Color Window
UP/DOWN ARROW-KEY : Raise/Lower selected Layer
+/- NUM KEYPAD : Add/Remove selected layer
ESC : Close Window/Program
